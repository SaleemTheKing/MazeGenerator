 ## How to run the program
 1. Make sure you are using Unity version 2020.1.4f1 installed and windows 10 or higher. I can not guarantee that this project will still work with other versions.
 2. Open the Unity Editor and press CTRL + B to build, you can also press the Play button in the editor to play without building.
 3. Go nuts!
